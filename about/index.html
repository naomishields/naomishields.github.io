<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Naomi Shields!</h1>
	<p>I'm in my fourth and final year of my undergraduate program at the University of Florida. I will be graduating in December 2020 with my BA in Statistics.
  After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in data science and/or machine learning. In my freetime I like to swim, read, and paint. </p>
