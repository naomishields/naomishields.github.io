	     <p>When I'm not thinking about numbers and code you can probably find me doing one of three things:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt> 1. Learning Languages </dt>
			<dd> - Just as programming languages can be used as tools to approach problems, I believe that spoken languages can also be used as tools to better understand the world around us.
			<dt> 2. Trying New Foods </dt>
			<dd> - I am a very adventurous eater and will try anything at least once. My favorite cuisines are Malaysian, Lebanese, and Jamaican.</dd>
			<dt> 3. Taking Care of My Plants </dt>
			<dd> - I either have a green thumb or I am very good at picking out resilient plants. Either way, I enjoy having looking after the plants that I have. </dd>
