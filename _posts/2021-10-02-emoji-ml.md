The purpose of this project was to answer the question, by uploading images of facial expressions, can we accurately predict the facial expression?

## Machine Learning

Tensorflow will be used to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model that will be used to classify expressions of uploaded black and white headshots. Google Colab was used to code the model and import all necessary python libraries to build initial saved model in a hdf (.h5) file format. The Colab file was then saved as a python file.

## Benefits of a CNN Model

Automatically detects the important features without human supervision. High accuracy rate for image classification and recognition. CNN is also proven effective with video, pattern and face recognition. The algorithm is fast and simple.

## Limitations of a CNN Model

Missing pixels can have a detrimental effect on the verification process of the model. If the CNN has several layers then the training process takes a lot of time if the computer doesn't consist of a good GPU. Requires a large dataset to process and train the neural network.

## Dashboard

FINAL DELIVERABLE - v1.0: User uploads a black and white head shot to the dashboard which sets off an event for the image to be processed by a convolutional neural network model that classifies the expression on the headshot. The top 3 identified classifications will be presented to the user along with the model's confidence level per classification of the prediction.

Bootstrap, HTML, and Javascript will be used to build the front end user interface (dashboard) with the ability to upload (with event listener) a black and white image for the classification model. Leverage Flask as the integration layer between the python model and the Javascript front end. Team is considering the option to include top 3 possible expression classifications sorted by model confidence level.
