I worked on a project that provides a multiple linear regression perspective to the problem of the coronavirus pandemic.
I used data provided by Johns Hopkins University with a multiple linear regression approach. 
The model I created uses the number of confirmed cases, number of recovered cases, and country and independent variables and the number of deaths as the dependent variable.
