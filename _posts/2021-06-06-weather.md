The purpose of this project was to improve functionality of a trip planning app using data pulled through API's. There were three highlights:

1. Weather desciptions were added to the weather data for possible travel destinations.
2. Users will be able to input their weather preferences to filter through the weather data. Based on these preferences, possible travel destinations will be identified along with nearby hotels.
3. After choosing four cities from the possible destinations, a travel itinerary will be created. Maps will also be created to accompany the intinerary.
