The purpose of this analysis was to analyze a set of data made up of amazon reviews. First a dataframe with just reviews with at least 20 votes was put together. Then after finding which reviews had more thna 20 votes it was further filtered to only reviews with more than half of the votes being helpful votes. After that it was broken into two separate dataframes, one for vine (paid) users and one for non-vine users. Finally, after breaking it into the two dataframes, both dataframes were analyzed to determine whether or not there was bias in the way that vine users reviewed products.
