The purpose of this project was to create a map of earthquake data. Using Javascript a map of GeoJSON data was able to be created. 
The map has three possible base layers:
* A *streets* layer 
* A *satellite streets* layer 
* A *dark* layer 

The map also has three overlays:
* An *earthquakes* overlay 
* A *tectonic plates* overlay 
* A *major earthquakes* overlay
